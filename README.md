This is advanced screenshoting software focused on ad verification screenshots.

It's primarily written in java but has several important components in javascript and other languages.
Notably - 
A component that can read DFP's obfuscated javascript objects to learn what ads it's serving to the page
A modified chromedriver which fixes a bug with screenshoting
A modified uBlock origin which doesn't remove ads it instead highlights them with an invisible css attribute.



This a complete product but we provide no warrenty or free support.
